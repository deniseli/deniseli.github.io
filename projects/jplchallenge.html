      The purpose of this project is to find safe landing sites for a lander on
      Mars. For more detail on the rules, constraints, and data files, please
      visit the above link to the competition's wiki.
    </p>
    <h2>Data Files</h2>
    <p>
      The team running this competition provided us with 4 sets of training
      data, with 4 files in each dataset. Our solution only uses the Digital
      Elevation Map (DEM) from each of these datasets, which is given in .pgm
      format. This is a 500 by 500 grid of heights in meters, with a resolution
      of 0.2 m/pixel.
    </p>
    <p>
      As output, our code is expected to output a 1000 by 1000 grid of integers
      designating whether each particular position is a safe landing site,
      supposing the center of the lander is at that particular point. The
      solution should be stored in a pgm format. In the solution, 0 means a
      location is not a safe landing site and 255 means a location is a safe
      landing site.
    </p>
    <h2>Constraints</h2>
    <p>
      In order to understand what a safe landing site is, we first need to
      understand what the lander looks like. The lander is circular. It has a
      3.4 m diameter base plate, with 4 footpads located at 90&deg; intervals
      around the edge of the base plate. Each footpad is circular and 0.5 m
      across. The ground clearance of the belly is 0.39 m.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two main constraints defining what constitutes a safe landing
      site, slope and roughness. The lander cannot safely land on a location
      of extreme slope, as it will be unstable and may slide or flip over. The
      threshold for slope is predefined as 10&deg;. The lander also cannot land
      on a location deemed too rough, meaning there must not be any rock or land
      formation under the belly of the lander that is tall enough to penetrate
      the base plate. This means there cannot be any rocks taller than 0.39 m.
    </p>

    <h2>Performance</h2>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    Let N = side length of the DEM (assuming a square shape)<br>
    Let X = number of points of roughness in the DEM<br>
    Slope: O(N<sup>2</sup>)<br>
    Roughness: O(N<sup>2</sup> + X)<br>
    Total computation complexity: O(N<sup>2</sup> + X)<br>
    Memory Usage: (5N<sup>2</sup>) * 32 bits
    <h3>Slope Optimizations</h3>
    <p>
      The naive solution would assume we need to check every possible set of 3
      landing points for the footpads of the rover, which would be at least the
      the circumference of the rover divided by average length in meters of a
      pixel in the DEM. Realistically, it would probably need to check more
      points to account for all possible positions where the tangent to the
      circle is not vertical or horizontal. This means checking at least 54
      points. Our solution only checks 16 points, so we cut out at least 70% of
      the runtime that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also chose to calculate the slopes using the plane normals, taking
      advantage of (and also optimizing for) the fact that the rover has 4
      discreet footpads, rather than calculating the gradient of the plane or
      calculating the gradient at the central point. Calculating the gradient of
      any plane is slower than finding its normal, so avoiding that in general is
      preferable. Further, calculating gradient at the central point would be
      inaccurate due to the nature of the problem - the rover is landing on
      footpads around its edges, not a single leg in the middle.
    </p>
    <h3>Roughness Optimizations</h3>
    <p>
      We define the naive solution to be iterating over each point in the DEM,
      calling getCircleIndices with c = the current point, and checking if any of
      those points are taller than any of the planes formed by 3 of the border
      points. Assuming this checks a constant number of angles A to find the
      border points, getCircleIndices returns C points, and the DEM is size NxN,
      the naive solution would run in time O(ACN<sup>2</sup>), which simplifies to
      O(N<sup>2</sup>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Our runtime in practice is much lower because we check if each point is
      the point of roughness, rather than if each possible circle contains a
      patch of roughness. We only call getCircleIndices if a point is rough,
      so the runtime is dependent on X, the number of points of that are
      raised/rough. We know X < N<sup>2</sup> and A is a large integer, so 
      O(N<sup>2</sup> + CX) < O(ACN<sup>2</sup>). However, because A and C are
      constants, our worse case runtime simplified is O(N<sup>2</sup> + X).
    </p>
    <h3>Worst Case vs Likely Case</h3>
    <p>
      Real runtime is inversely proportional to the amount of slope in the given
      terrain. This is not reflected in O(N^2 + X) because the worst case
      remains the same no matter how much slope there is. Our code breaks out of
      the loop checking for slope at a given point once it knows the point is
      sloped, which only affects big-Omega and Theta. Further, because the
      getCircleIndices function used in our roughness calculations runs faster
      when more of the points being checked in the circle have been set to 0,
      our roughness calculation also runs faster when more points have been
      blocked out due to slope.
    </p>
    <h2>Accuracy on the Training Data</h2>
    <p>
      We have the solution outputed by our algorithm on the left. On the right,
      we have the difference between our solution and the real solution. We are
      using the default colors from <a href="http://matplotlib.org">matplotlib</a>,
      so on the left, red = 255 and blue = 0. On the right, green = correct, red
      = false negative, and blue = false positive. We especially want to avoid
      false positives, or incorrectly labeling an unsafe zone, because that could
      lead to catastrophic failure, whereas a false negative would only mean
      artificially limitted options.

    <h3>FAQ</h3>
    <b>1. You're using the height given in the DEM for roughness, but that doesn't
    take the slope of the ground into consideration.</b><br>
    We are filtering out all locations with a slope greater than 10 degrees, so
    in the worst case scenario, the roughness code needs to handle a 10 degree
    slope. cos(10&deg;) = 0.9848. So, in theory, the surface normal should be
    taken into account, but with a difference of only 1.52%, this calculation
    is unneccesary with a suitably conservative roughness constant.<br><br>
    <b>2. I tried downloading the zip files and running your code on it, but it
    isn't working!</b><br>
    There is a typo in the naming consistency of the zips. That typo is fixed in
    the unzipped data files on github, so try again with those. If you <i>need</i>
    to use the zips for whatever reason, just look at the directory and file
    names. The error should jump out at you.<br><br>
    <b>3. I still don't understand the roughness part.</b><br>
