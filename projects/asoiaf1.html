      This page contains spoilers for all the books in <b>A Song of Ice and
      Fire</b>, by George R. R. Martin. Do not continue unless you have
      finished reading the series, or if you do not plan on ever reading
      the series (which would be the wrong choice).

      The purpose of this project is find textual motifs in ASOIAF by analyzing
      the variations in word frequencies and bigram frequencies for each unique
      point of view. Simple word frequencies will be used to find the likely
      starts of motifs, and the bigrams following from those given starting
      points. We will rank both word and bigram frequencies in each POV within
      each book by:
    </p>
    <p><center>
      (# occurrences in X POV chapters) / (# occurrences in all chapters)
    </center></p>
    <p>
      Note that for testing purposes, we would expect "Where do whores go" to be
      returned as a motif in Tyrion's chapters.
    </p>
    <p>
      This page is my slightly edited stream of consciousness while working
      towards this goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, for the sake of making processing easier, we need to break down the
      complete texts into separate files by POV, instead of by book. We also
      want to remove the question marks, since those would confuse the bigram
      finder (" "SomeWord " would be considered different from " SomeWord" ",
      as well as every other variation of no quotes, quotes on one side, or even
      quotes on both sides of a word, which is not the desired behavior.). We
      also need to make all the text the same case (lowercase, here), so the
      same phrase located at the beginning and the middle of a sentence will be
      considered keys to the same count. Finally we need to clean up the white
      space and remove all the unnecessary newlines, double spaces, etc. Here's
      a sample of the cleaned text, from Arya's chapters in
      <i>A Game of Thrones</i>:
    </p>
    <div style="margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px;"><p><i>
      who are you? arya asked. i am your dancing master. he tossed her one of
      the wooden blades. she grabbed for it, missed, and heard it clatter to the
      floor. tomorrow you will catch it. now pick it up. it was not just a
      stick, but a true wooden sword complete with grip and guard and pommel.
      arya picked it up and clutched it nervously with both hands, holding it
      out in front of her.
    </i></p></div>
    <p>
      The resulting files from this process can be accessed on github under the
      povs/ directory (see the link to code at the top of this page).
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, with the text all cleaned and sorted, we need to count the number
      of times each word occurs in each POV. For each of these, I first cleaned
      the text further to remove punctuation using the 
      <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html">re</a> module. I used
      the Counter object in the
      <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html">
	collections</a> module to get the actual word frequencies on the text
      split on spaces. I kept a sum of the counts in each POV per book, the
      total number of occurrences for each word in each book. This per book
      count was stored using the
      <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html">pickle</a> module.
      Next, I found the POV to book count ratios for each POV, per the formula
      given above. These, I similarly stored using pickle. The first couple
      results for each POV here tend to be, quite predictably, the names of the
      narrator's companions which are either unknown or irrelevant to all the
      other POVs. For example, Bran's top 4 results in <i>A Storm of Swords</i>,
      all used exclusively by him (per the ratio being 1.0), are:
    </p>
    <div style="margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px;"><p><i>
      'osha': 1.0, 'frog': 1.0, "hodor's": 1.0, 'meera': 1.0
    </i></p></div>
    <p>
      (As an aside, it's pretty entertaining looking at all the variations of
      HOOODOOOOOR throughout the text. It might be interesting to graph the
      correlation between frequency_of_hodors*average_hodor_length and some
      sentiment analysis for Bran's chapters over time.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, moving further down the list we see some more interesting results:
    </p>
    <div style="margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px;"><p><i>
      'summer': 0.6024096385542169, 'stories': 0.5357142857142857,
      'causeway': 0.5333333333333333, 'lake': 0.5319148936170213,
      'story': 0.5217391304347826, 'net': 0.5172413793103449, 'embers': 0.5,
      'rat': 0.5, 'deer': 0.5, 'moonlight': 0.47368421052631576,
      'stableboy': 0.46153846153846156, 'crypts': 0.45454545454545453,
      'footsteps': 0.4444444444444444
    </i></p></div>
    <p>
      It appears that between 0.25 and 0.8, we see a lot of environmental
      descriptors and imagery. While this is not immediately helpful for our
      motif finding goal, it's definitely worth taking another look at, perhaps
      in another project. There is also evidence of a problem with our method
      here. By making all the characters lowercase, we have unintentionally
      combined the counts for 'summer' the season and 'Summer' the direwolf.
      This would be a difficult problem to solve, however, since at the start
      of a sentence, there would be no distinction between the two at all.
      Given the small scale of this project, I'll just leave this as a 'won't
      fix' known issue which we should keep in mind in our analysis, but really
      isn't a big deal in the grand scheme of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next step would be to calculate the bigram frequencies. I considered
      using nltk's BigramCollocationFinder, but that wouldn't give me the counts
      or the specific format I want the data to be in, so I decided to just do
      this part by hand. I modeled a simple Bayesian network using a dictionary
      where the top level keys are the first words in the bigrams, the second
      level keys are the following words in the bigrams, and the value each
      secondary key points to is the fraction of times the given secondary word
      followed the given first word when the first word appeared, or:
    </p>
    <p><center>
      dict['azor']['ahai'] = (# times 'azor ahai' occurs) / (# of times 'azor'
      occurs)
    </center></p>
    <p>
      The challenge here is determining whether punctuation should impact the
      "motifiness" of a phrase containing a specific series of bigrams. For the
      sake of this project, I decided to make a judgement call and say bigrams
      where the first word ends in a period, i.e. this bigram crosses the end
      of a sentence, do not count. Likewise, bigrams where the first word ends
      in an exclamation point, question mark, etc., will not be counted.
      However, commas will be allowed and simply ignored. That is to say,
      occurrences of "x, y" will be counted toward the same total as "x y". I
      chose to allow commas because they are so variable in allowed placements,
      so should a character take an extra pause (I am equating commas to pauses,
      for the sake of this exercise) while saying something that could be
      considered a motif, that instance will still count toward said motif's
      total count. That said, bear in mind my decision here is based off of
      almost no data and severely impacted by my personal biases, so it is
      definitely worth investigating bigram counts with a different
      interpretation of the possible punctuations.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, it's also worth noting that one of the main problems with
      using bigram analysis to find motifs is that it is only possible to form
      2-word assocations, and it is technically impossible to draw definite
      continued phrases from that. Take, for example, the phrase:
    </p>
    <div style="margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px;"><p><i>
      "The sea was black and the moon was silver" (Victarion I, A Dance With
      Dragons)
    </i></p></div>
    <p>
      This phrase gets broken up into:
    </p>
    <div style="margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px;"><p><i>
      {'and': {'the': 1}, 'moon': {'was': 1}, 'black': {'and': 1}, 'sea':
      {'was': 1}, 'the': {'sea': 1, 'moon': 1}, 'was': {'black': 1,
      'silver': 1}}
    </i></p></div>
    <p>
      From here, it is impossible to tell if the original phrase was "The sea
      was black and the moon was silver" or "The sea was silver and the moon was
      black." Therefore, we also need to crossreference each potential motif
      with the original text to make sure it actually appears in the text.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now would be a good time to revisit the example motif, "where do whores
      go" for Tyrion in <i>A Dance With Dragons</i>. Broken into bigrams "where
      do", "do whores", and "whores go", we can look at the number of
      occurrences for each listed bigram divided by the total number of
      occurrences for all bigrams begining with "where", "do", and "whores",
      which we will call C<sub>Tyrion</sub> for counts in that POV and
      C<sub>All</sub> for counts in all POVs:
    </p>
    <center><table cellpadding="3" border="1" bordercolor="black" style="border-collapse:collapse">
      <tr>
	<th>Bigram</th>
	<th>C<sub>Tyrion</sub></th>
	<th>C<sub>All</sub></th>
	<th>C<sub>Tyrion</sub> / C<sub>All</sub></th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>where -> do</td>
	<td>0.0409836065574</td>
	<td>0.017825311943</td>
	<td>2.29918032787</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>do -> whores</td>
	<td>0.0245398773006</td>
	<td>0.00470035252644</td>
	<td>5.22085889571</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>whores -> go</td>
	<td>0.179487179487</td>
	<td>0.118644067797</td>
	<td>1.51282051282</td>
      </tr>
    </table></center>
    <p>
      Judging from this, we should be able to find the bigrams with the highest
      C<sub>POV</sub> / C<sub>All</sub> ratios and follow along the path of
      bigrams, picking the most common next word and most common previous word,
      until we hit a word that doesn't have a bigram with a ratio over, say,
      1.5.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ended up chosing to take the top two bigrams, rather than just the top
      single bigram, for each iteration, mainly due to the fact that we are
      looking for phrases greater than two words long, so we cannot guarentee
      that every bigram in a motif will be the bigram with the highest ratio
      given its first word. Two was an arbitrary cutoff, but for the purposes
      of this project, seemed to serve well. I further verified each new
      possible motif was still contained in the actual text of the books.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we apply this algorithm to Tyrion's chapters in <i>A Dance With
      Dragons</i>, we do, in fact, get our expected motif, "where do whores go"!
      Interestingly, we even see a number of similar motifs to that one,
      including "know where whores go," and "that be where whores go."
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, this algorithm did produce more false positives than desirable,
      but the results were generally satisfactory. This number of false
      positives could be expected, since not all POVs in all books contain
      significant texual motifs. The results are listed, labeled by book and
      POV, below.
